        </ul>

        <p><strong>Action Required:</strong><br>
        Download your files before the links expire.<br>
        If you do not retrieve your files within 7 days, you will need to submit a new <a href="https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?template=data_archival_request.yml" target="_blank">GitHub Issue</a> to retrieve your files. To do so:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Open a new GitHub issue using the unique URL found in the WHERE-ARE-MY-FILES.txt file.</li>
            <li>Ensure that you have included both the UC Berkeley email address and the link to your DataHub folder, which should follow this format: <code>gs://ucb-datahub-archived-homedirs/semester-archived/hub-url/calnet-id.tar.gz</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Steps to Extract Your Archived Files:</strong><br>
        If you need help extracting the downloaded .tar file, please read below: (This information is targeted for users using Windows 11 or earlier versions).</p>

        <p><strong>What is a .tar file?</strong><br>
        A .tar file is a type of compressed file that holds many other files inside it, kind of like a folder zipped into one file. To access the files inside, you need to "untar" (or extract) them.</p>

        <p><strong>Steps to Untar a .tar File:</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download the .tar File:</strong> When you click on the shared link, you will be downloading a .tar file to your device. It could look something like <code>your-calnet-id.tar</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Open the Terminal (Command Line):</strong> You need to either use the "Terminal" (on Mac/Linux) or "Command Prompt" (on Windows) to untar the file.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On Windows:</strong> If you don’t have a program like 7-Zip, you can install it first.</li>
                <li><strong>On Mac/Linux:</strong> The Terminal is already available, so you can open it from your Applications folder (Mac) or search for it in your app list (Linux).</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Navigate to the Folder with the .tar File:</strong> Locate the .tar file. In Terminal or Command Prompt, use the <code>cd</code> command to navigate to the folder containing the file.</li>
            <li><strong>Run the Command to Untar:</strong> Once you're in the right folder, type the following command to untar the file:</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>On Mac/Linux:</strong> Type this command in the Terminal:
                    <pre><code>tar -xvf your-calnet-id.tar</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><strong>On Windows:</strong> If you are using 7-Zip, right-click the .tar file, then choose <strong>7-Zip > Extract Here</strong>. This will extract the files in the same location.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><strong>Find Your Extracted Files:</strong> After the command runs (or you extract with 7-Zip), you should see a new folder (or a bunch of new files) appear. These are your files from DataHub that were inside the .tar archive.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Best,</p>

        <p><strong>DataHub Support Team</strong></p>
